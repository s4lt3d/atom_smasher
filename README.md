This sketch visualizes a system of particles that interact with each other based on their charges. They exert forces on each other, causing acceleration and movement. The particles' positions are plotted on the screen, creating a visual representation of these interactions. The sketch can save frames as images, and the background can be cleared by pressing the mouse.
